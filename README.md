# Mental Health Fitness Tracker
## Overview
The Mental Health Fitness Tracker is a data-driven application designed to monitor and improve users' mental well-being. It combines advanced machine learning algorithms with insightful visualizations to provide personalized recommendations for stress management, anxiety reduction, and overall mental health enhancement.

## Data Collection and Preparation
The project uses two datasets for mental health analysis: "mental-and-substance-use-as-share-of-disease.csv" and "prevalence-by-mental-and-substance-use-disorder.csv". The data is imported and merged into a single DataFrame, and any missing values are handled appropriately.

## Visualizations and Insights
The application employs various visualizations, including heatmaps, joint plots, pair plots, and pie charts, to help users better understand their mental health patterns and trends. These insights foster greater self-awareness and informed decision-making for improved mental well-being.

## Testing and Iteration
The application is thoroughly tested, and user feedback is gathered to iterate on design and functionalities. This iterative process aims to enhance user experience and effectiveness in promoting mental health management.

## Machine Learning Models
Two machine learning models are used in the project:

Linear Regression: This model establishes linear relationships between input features (e.g., sleep patterns, stress levels) and mental health outcomes (e.g., mood fluctuations, anxiety levels). It provides interpretable insights into the impact of different factors on mental well-being.

Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees, Random Forest captures nonlinear relationships between input features and mental health outcomes. This enhances the accuracy and comprehensiveness of mental health predictions.

## Model Performance
The performance of both Linear Regression and Random Forest models is evaluated on training and testing sets. Metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared are utilized to assess their predictive capabilities.

Please note that the Mental Health Fitness Tracker is a prototype and should not replace professional mental health advice or treatment. It serves as a tool to raise awareness and promote better mental well-being.

##  Getting Started
To use the Mental Health Fitness Tracker, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

`pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib plotly scikit-learn`
Next, run the provided code to load the data and train the machine learning models. Modify and customize the application as needed to suit your specific use case and target audience.
